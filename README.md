# Variable_Casing

## Note: Always use variables in lower case in programming.

# Snake Case:
```
Snake case separates each word with an underscore character (_).
When using snake case, all letters need to be lowercase.
    number_of_donuts = 34
    fave_phrase = "Hello World"
```

# Kebab Case:
```
The kebab case is very similar to snake case.
The difference between snake case and kebab case is that kebab case separates each word with a dash character, -, instead of an underscore.
    number-of-donuts = 34
    fave-phrase = "Hello World"
```

# Camel Case:
```
When using camel case, you start by making the first word lowercase. Then, you capitalize the first letter of each word that follows.
    numberOfDonuts = 34
    favePhrase = "Hello World"
```

# Pascal Case:
```
Pascal case is similar to camel case.
The only difference between the two is that pascal case requires the first letter of the first word to also be capitalized.
    NumberOfDonuts = 34
    FavePhrase = "Hello World"
```
